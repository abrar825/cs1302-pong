## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app,
> including the app category that you chose, and the
> primary functions available to users of the app.

I chose to create Pong, a classic arcade game that everyone is familiar
with. Two players are able to play using the W, S, and arrow keys. The
game allows replay and a quit function.


## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you
> learned from working on this project?


I learned a lot about how to create your own makeshift collision detection
methods and customise them to do what you require them to do.


## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch,
> what do you think might do differently and why?


I might go in and add a CPU mode because I think it would be neat to have
coded a competent computer that gets harder as you progress levels. I also
would like to learn more about graphics styling in JavaFX just to make my game look
a little neater
